    I am learning to code as a hobby. It's something I've come back to now and then, but I am stil learning.
    I don't know how or why, but a user named exaluc started watching some of my repositories.

    I created this to try and get his attention to see if he would follow me.

  Hi exaluc, my name is Andy and I see you followed some of my repositories. <br>

    As you can probably tell, I am a beginner. I keep my online presence seperate to my IRL presence so I don't know any other GitHub users.
    I was just wondering if you would follow me? I don't know any other users on github so I just thought I'd ask.
